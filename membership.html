          <div class="accordion-content">
            Sanctory operates on an invitation-only basis. Occasionally, we
            allow referrals from existing members to invite friends and family.
            This quiet, considered approach allows us to plan demand in a way
            that aligns with the natural pace of our producers, many of whom
            work with traditional, small-scale methods. By doing so, we ensure
            that quality remains consistent across every batch and each member
            receives a product that is genuinely special, without any
            compromise.

          <div class="accordion-content">
            Currently, new members are accepted through invitations extended by
            existing members or during specific open enrollment periods
            announced by Sanctory. You can register your interest on our site,
            and we’ll notify you if new spots become available.

            WHY ISN’T SANCTORY OPEN TO ALL?
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            Our selective approach helps us maintain a high standard of curation
            and quality. It allows producers to focus on craftsmanship rather
            than volume and ensures each member experiences exclusivity and
            uniqueness in every product.

            Sanctory products reflect the craftsmanship, scarcity, and ethical
            practices behind their creation. While prices vary, our focus is
            always on fair compensation for producers and delivering unmatched

          <div class="accordion-content">
            No, Sanctory products are exclusive to our platform and are not
            distributed through third-party sellers. This ensures authenticity
            and maintains our direct relationship between producer and member.

            While membership grants you access to our full catalog, some items

            on producer capacity. Notifications and priority access are provided
            to ensure fair availability.
